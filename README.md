Social Hotspots Detection

The widespread usage of social media platforms can provide much insight into activity occurring in real-time around the
world. Much of this user-generated content is tagged with geo-location data either with explicit gps coordinates or
implicitly from other location metadata. This can be leveraged to detect and classify clusters of emerging social activity,
or hotspots. Classifying the hotspots into discrete categories and sentiment further adds context to the nature of the
activity. There are numerous applications to this type of system including news, situational awareness, crime detection
and response, advertising and much more.
